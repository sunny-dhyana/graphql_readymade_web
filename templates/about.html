        <h4>What is GraphQL?</h4>
        <p>
          GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs,
          and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It was originally
          developed by Facebook and is now maintained by the open-source community.
        </p>

        <h4>What is GraphQL ReadyMade Web?</h4>
        <p>
          GraphQL ReadyMade Web is a sample web application built on top of GraphQL.
          It demonstrates how a GraphQL API can be integrated into a modern web stack,
          including querying, mutations, and schema-driven development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is intended as a reference implementation for developers who want
          to explore GraphQL concepts, experiment with API design, and understand how
          clients and servers interact using GraphQL.
