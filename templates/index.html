    <h1 class="mt-4">GraphQL ReadyMade Web</h1>
    <hr />

    <h4>Welcome!</h4>
    <p>
      GraphQL ReadyMade Web is a simple demonstration application built using GraphQL.
      It provides a ready-to-use backend API along with a web interface to explore queries, mutations, and
      subscriptions.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4>Getting Started</h4>
    <p>
      This application exposes a GraphQL endpoint that you can interact with using the built-in UI
      or any GraphQL client such as Apollo, Insomnia, or curl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the navigation menu to explore available features and try out different queries.
      The API supports standard GraphQL operations and follows common schema conventions.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4>Application Modes</h4>
    <p>
      The application supports multiple operating modes that can be configured globally.
      These modes control how the server processes and validates GraphQL requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch modes from the top bar menu or by sending the HTTP header
      <code>X-GRMW-MODE</code> with your requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no mode is specified, the application will use the default configuration.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h4>Mode Overview</h4>
    <h5>Standard</h5>
    <p>
      The Standard mode provides a straightforward GraphQL setup with minimal constraints,
      suitable for development and experimentation.
    </p>

    <h5>Advanced</h5>
    <p>
      The Advanced mode enables additional query validation and performance controls,
      such as depth limits and request analysis, making it more suitable for production-like usage.
    </p>

    <br />
